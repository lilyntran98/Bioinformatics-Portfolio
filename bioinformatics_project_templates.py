# Bioinformatics + Process Development Project Templates

This repository showcases three bioinformatics and bioprocess-focused projects, ideal for graduate students or professionals with a background in viral vector process development and data analysis. These projects demonstrate the use of Python, R, shell scripting, and basic bioinformatics tools to analyze and simulate biological data.

## üìÅ Project 1: Simulated Viral Vector Purification Model

**Description:**
Simulates downstream purification steps (e.g., TFDF, chromatography) and performs statistical analysis to evaluate yield, pressure, and impurity levels using Python.

**Skills used:** Python, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, simulated data, statistical analysis

**Files:**
- `simulate_process.py`: script to simulate and visualize purification data
- `data/simulated_run_data.csv`: generated dataset
- `figures/yield_vs_impurity.png`: result visualizations

## üß¨ Project 2: NGS Read Mapping & Variant Calling Pipeline

**Description:**
A shell script pipeline that performs alignment, sorting, indexing, and variant calling using commonly used tools in NGS workflows.

**Skills used:** BWA, samtools, bcftools, Linux/bash scripting

**Files:**
- `scripts/align.sh`: end-to-end shell script for variant calling
- `data/`: input FASTQ and reference files (not included due to size)
- `results/`: sample outputs (VCF, BAM)

---

## üìä Project 3: Omics Data Visualization Dashboard

**Description:**
Uses Jupyter Notebook and Python to visualize gene expression data using PCA and heatmaps.

**Skills used:** pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, data visualization

**Files:**
- `notebooks/dashboard_visualization.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with PCA and volcano plot visualizations
- `data/gene_expression_matrix.csv`: example dataset
- `figures/`: saved output plots
